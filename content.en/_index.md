Hi, my name is Daniel Ise, I'm 31 years old. I'm from Santiago del Estero, province of Argentina, and this is my personal blog.

I'll publish here my keynotes about programation and computer science.
I'll showcase my software here too.

This page has 2 versions. This one is the English version. I'll try to keep both updated, but there's a chance that
the spanish one is more up to date.

Welcome!
